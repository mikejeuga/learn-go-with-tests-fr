This repository is the base for the translation in French of Chris James' book [Learn Go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)

## Why

* Chris wrote an awesome book that helps me learn Go and the TDD process.
* Not all French speaking developers have the patience or sometimes the brain energy to read a technical book in another language. 
* The hope that it pushes TDD and Go further in French speaking regions of the globe.
* It is a fun exercise.
* There are translation in Chinese, Portuguese and other language so why not en Fran√ßais.
